Example 7.3.2 is an example system of oscillations in glycolysis. It demonstrates the Poincar√©-Bendixson Theorem and shows that changes in the two parameters of the system cause the formation of either a stable limit cycle or a stable fixed point. Further, the values of these parameters can be analyzed in such a way that predicts the behavior of the system based on where the points fall in parameter space. This post explores this example.
