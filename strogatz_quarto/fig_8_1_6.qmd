Figure 8.1.6 of Strogatz is an exmaple of a supercritical pitchfork, wherein a bifurcation happens that splits a single fixed point into 3 fixed points depending on the value of a parameter in the system of equations.

The systems of equations in question is:

$$ \dot x = \mu x - x^3 $$
$$ \dot y = -y $$

In this post I examine phase portraits of this system with multiple values for mu to show this behvaior.

But first, I willd define several functions to draw the phase portraits.
