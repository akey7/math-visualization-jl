## Phase Portrait Inspiration

Chapter 5 in Strogatz, 3rd edition has many great phase portraits! In this post, I seek to make similar phase portraits in code so that I can understand the portriats better.

### Inspired by Figure 5.2.2

Leading up to figure 5.2, we are taken through solving the following:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\dot x \\
\dot y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
4 & -2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
$$

In this document section, I will call 2x2 matrices of the above form *A*.
