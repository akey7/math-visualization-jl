## Phase Portrait Inspiration

Chapter 5 in Strogatz, 3rd edition has many great phase portraits! In this post, I seek to make similar phase portraits in code so that I can understand the portriats better.

### Inspired by Figure 5.2.2

Leading up to figure 5.2, we are taken through solving the following:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\dot x \\
\dot y
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
4 & -2
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The text's solution solves for initial conditions:

$$ (x_0, y_0) = (2, 3) $$

In the following plot, I will solve for many initial conditions to make the phase portrait as shown in the Julia code below. Also, I will call the 2x2 matrices in the equation above *A*.
