"""
    tension(; s::Float64, x::Float64, w::Float64, guess_lower::Float64, guess_upper::Float64)

Calculate tension at bottom of a suspension cable hung from two supports.

Arguments
1. `s::Float64` Total length of the cable in feet.
2. `x::Float64` Distance of bottom of cable from supports in feet.
3. `w::Float64` Weight of the cable in lb/ft
4. `guess_lower::Float64` Lower bound of guessed tension range. For the solver.
5. `guess_upper::Float64` Upper bound of guessed tension range. For the solver.

Returns
`Vector{Float64}`
Vector of solutions to the tension equation.

    curve(; xs::Vector{Float64}, dist_from_support::Float64, w::Float64, s::Float64, guess_lower::Float64, guess_upper::Float64)

Calculate curve of a suspension cable (supported by two supports) from one support to another.

Arguments
1. `xs::Vector{Float64}` Vector of x coordinates along which to calculate the curve.
2. `dist_from_support::Float64` Distance of the bottom of the cable from the support.
3. `w::Float64` Weight of the cable in lb/ft
4. `s::Float64` Total length of the cable in feet.
5. `guess_lower::Float64` Lower bound of guessed tension range. For the solver. Should encompass all possible ranges of tensions.
6. `guess_upper::Float64` Upper bound of guessed tension range. For the solver. Should encompass all possible ranges of tensions.

Returns
`Vector{Float64}`
Y coordinates corresponding to each x coordinate.
